            <article class="story-content">
              <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Setting</h2>
              <p>The protagonist awakens in suffocating darkness. His head throbs, his body aches, and a sickening chill creeps over him as he realizes both his hands are chained to the cold, unyielding wall behind him. Panic swells as his mind races to make sense of where he is and why he's trapped.</p>

              <p>Suddenly, a dim light buzzes to life in the middle of the room, illuminating a young woman—Riley Rose—sprawled on the ground, disoriented and confused.</p>

              <p>Riley stirs, her wide, frightened eyes darting around the room as she tries to remember how she got there. Her breathing quickens when she notices the chains binding the boy at the edge of the room. Then, she hears his voice—a low, shaky whisper calling out to her. Her fear collides with compassion as she stumbles toward him, her own confusion melting into concern.</p>

              <p>Using a small tool she finds nearby, Riley fumbles to unlock the chains, her hands trembling with fear but driven by determination. After what feels like an eternity, she frees him. "Are you okay?" she asks, her voice soft but urgent. Despite her own terror, she prioritizes his safety. It's an instinct she doesn't fully understand, but one she can't ignore.</p>

              <p>As the darkness surrounds them once more, their shared fear becomes their bond. Together, they vow to escape this twisted game, though neither of them knows what lies ahead—or if survival is even possible.</p>

              <!-- The Journey Section -->
              <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Journey</h2>
              <p>The maze they navigate is a horrifying labyrinth of traps and puzzles, each deadlier than the last. Riley quickly proves to be the emotional heart of the duo. She checks on the protagonist constantly, worrying about his injuries and health, offering comfort when his resolve begins to falter.</p>

              <p>The protagonist, though shaken and overwhelmed, finds himself relying on her strength more than he thought possible. Riley's unwavering belief in him becomes a light in the darkness, and he begins to draw strength not just from her words but from her presence.</p>

              <p>Their connection deepens as they move forward, each trap bringing them closer together. In a moment of respite, they share their fears, their hopes, and their doubts. Riley's warmth becomes a source of hope for him, and he, in turn, becomes her anchor. For the first time in their lives, they both feel like they have someone to fight for.</p>

              <!-- The Final Act Section -->
              <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Final Act</h2>
              <p>After what feels like an eternity of trials, they reach the heart of the facility—a control room containing a bomb. They realize the device is their only way to destroy this place and ensure no one else suffers. Together, they set the timer, knowing they only have minutes to escape.</p>

              <p>They race toward the exit, a narrow vent door leading to freedom. But just as they reach it, the door slams shut, crushing the protagonist's hand in the process. He screams in pain, collapsing to the ground. Riley panics, trying desperately to pry the door open. Blood drips from his hand as they both pull with all their strength, but it won't budge.</p>

              <p>The bomb's timer continues to tick.</p>

              <p>The protagonist realizes the truth before Riley does: one of them has to stay behind. As she continues to fight the door, he grabs her wrist gently but firmly. "You have to go," he says, his voice raw with emotion.</p>

              <p>"No! I'm not leaving you!" Riley sobs, shaking her head, her tears falling freely as she pounds on the door in frustration.</p>

              <p>He smiles through the pain, a sad yet peaceful expression on his face. "You have to live," he whispers. "This is my choice. Please, Riley… go."</p>

              <p>Riley's heart shatters as she collapses beside him, clutching his shirt, begging him to change his mind. But he only brushes her tears away, his own eyes brimming with sorrow and love. "I'm not afraid anymore," he says softly. "I'm just glad I met you."</p>

              <p>The timer ticks down, and Riley knows she has no choice. With trembling hands, she kisses his forehead, whispering, "I'm so sorry…" before turning and running through the emergency hatch he forces open for her.</p>

              <p>As she escapes into the light, the bomb detonates. The entire facility collapses behind her, the explosion ripping through the ground. Riley falls to her knees, her screams lost in the deafening roar of destruction. She looks back, her heart breaking as she realizes the boy who saved her is gone.</p>

              <!-- Ending Section -->
              <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Ending</h2>
              <p>Riley stands in the ruins of the facility, the sun casting a golden glow over the shattered landscape. In her hands, she clutches a small token—a keychain or a note she found in his pocket during their journey—a final reminder of the boy who gave his life for hers.</p>

              <p>Her tears fall silently as she gazes at the horizon, her heart heavy with grief. But somewhere deep within her, she feels his presence, his hope for her survival. She knows she must live on, not just for herself but for him.</p>

              <p class="fst-italic fw-bold">The screen fades to black, leaving players with the weight of her loss and the memory of the love and sacrifice that defined their journey.</p>
